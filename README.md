## Marketing and web development - a suite for local businesses to combat franchise companies and big corp. Everyone can be a millionaire by escaping the 9-5 and starting the business of their dreams.

### Jakes Domain is:
- A place to get a website built or have one built for you. I share my modern tech knowledge and repositories so you don't need to do the heavy lifting.
- A set of digital tools and advice that doesn't take advantage of you. For example, if you even need an LLC you should file it directly with the state; Bizee, Legal Zoom, Zen Business, Tailor Brands will gladly file for you for the same price BUT they will sell your info to everyone. I had 3 different businesses call me nonstop for SEO marketing each quoting hundreds when you can learn to do this for FREE. If they are on top of google as "sponsored ads" they are paying to be there and overshadowing cheaper options (think of the big picture!) always triangulate info between review conduits you trust (google, reddit, etc) I do not trust trustpilot
- A community of other local entrepreneurs and national entrepreneurs. You are expected to sponsor a new business into the community if you are a marketing liasion.
- A marketing strategy that gets you seen. Signs, word of mouth, and networking have been used by successful businesses for years. Mailed advertising is my next experimental project and I am confident it will be successful.
- If you grow past 20 employees or gross $1,000,000 profit, you will have graduated into a different community. This is a cliff for the little guy to climb. I myself haven't made it to the top. Maybe once I'm there, I will make a platform for rich owners.
