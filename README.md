# Homepage

My landing page is going to be a series of sections that reflect what ive learned

Current ToDos:

- Separate sections into tabs, add animations
- github links to go along with project links
- create cards for list items
- learning blog
- game art and sounds
- objects with list data

- combine all projects into one section and add works done for others
- add rolling cube in background with responsive lighting?
